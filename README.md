# Rails Project - Food Reviews App 

>  In this project I built an app to give opinions about food and food related things, it has a functionality like Tweeter, where you can post an opinion or review on a feed that every user is able to see. Each user is able to post reviews, and follow or unfollow other users, see their profiles and check the profile of other users to see their statistics, like number of reviews, number of followers and number of users followed by that user.
